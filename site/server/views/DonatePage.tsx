                                        To bring about a better future, we need
                                        data and research to understand the big
                                        problems the world is facing and how to
                                        make progress against them. That’s why
                                        we make all our work free and accessible
                                        for everyone.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We are a nonprofit. This means we rely
                                        on donations and grants to keep us
                                        going. Reader donations are essential to
                                        our work, providing us with the
                                        stability and independence we need, so
                                        we can focus on showing the data and
                                        evidence we think everyone needs to
                                        know.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Donating is also one way to show us that
                                        you find our work helpful and valuable.
                                        Knowing this is a huge source of
                                        inspiration for our team.
                                    </p>

                                        If you want to help us do more, please
                                        donate today – it will make a real
                                        difference.
